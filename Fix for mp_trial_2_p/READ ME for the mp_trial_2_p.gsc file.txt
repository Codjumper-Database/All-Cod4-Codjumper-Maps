How to play mp_tample_2_p without it crashing:

1. Click on mp_tample_2_p.gsc in the repository.
2. Find the "download raw file" on the page in front of you and click on it.
3. You have now downloaded the raw file.
4. Choose which (codjumper) mod you want to use to play the map.
5. Go to the folder of the (codjumper) mod. It's located at ...\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare\Mods\<the mod you use>
Create a new folder and change its name to 'maps'.
6. Open the folder 'maps' and create another folder called 'mp'.
7. Open the folder 'mp' and copy-paste the mp_tample_2_p.gsc file to this place.
So the file should basically be in this directory: ...\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare\Mods\<the mod you use>\maps\mp\mp_tample_2_p.gsc
8. Open Call of Duty 4 and launch the mod. Now you should be able to load the map by typing in console: /devmap mp_tample_2_p
