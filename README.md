Those versions often help cj-servers to host them more properly.  
It also includes useful files for the tool Bouncebuilder 1.0 and Bouncebuilder 2.0

*(The full functionality of Bouncebuilder v1.0 has been made possible by 3xP' Fr33g !t, ZeeZ & Viruz + IzNoGoD)*  
*(The full functionality of Bouncebuilder v2.0 has been made possible by 3xP' Fr33g !t, ZeeZ, Viruz & AlterEgo + IzNoGoD)*

### Map fixes
Some maps require some kind of fix to make them work (more properly).  
There is an available fix for mp_duchsnoep, mp_scarlet_citadel and mp_trial_2_p.  
They can be found in their respective folder in the repository including a readme-file for each.
